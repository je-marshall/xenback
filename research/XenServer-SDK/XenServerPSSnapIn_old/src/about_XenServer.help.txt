
Welcome to the XenServer PowerShell SnapIn v6.2.0-1
-----------------------------------------------------

For specific help with any command use:

Get-Help [CommandName]

For a list of all possible commands type:

Get-Command -PSSnapIn XenServerPSSnapIn


Many XenServer cmdlets allow you to identify target objects in several
different ways. For example a VM could be identified by its uuid,
opaque ref, a VM XenRef, or a VM object itself. These indentifiers can
be piped in from other commands as well as passed as parameters.
The following example shows several ways to call Set-XenServer:SR.NameLabel
by identifying the storage repository in several different ways.

Set-XenServer:SR.NameLabel -SR 2689f540-082b-11cf-5598-b0648578a35b -Value "My new SR label"

Set-XenServer:SR.NameLabel -SR OpaqueRef:7bd971d4-0fa9-5639-f6ba-7376680bd2e0 -Value "My new SR label"

Get-XenServer:SR -NameFilter "My old SR label" | Set-XenServer:SR.NameLabel -Value "My new SR label"


In addition to this, all commandlets have three extra parameters which
allow you to specify a Url, Server and a Port:

Verb-Noun [-Url [<String>]] [-Server [<String>]] [-Port [<Int>]]

These parameters allow you to specify which of the open XenServer sessions
you wish to use.

When connected to multiple sessions it may be desirable to select a
default session that cmdlets can use. Setting the default session variable
with a session object will provide this functionality:

$XenServer_Default_Session = Get-XenServer:Sessions -svr svrname
